        3. Write a Java program to calculate the revenue from a sale based on the unit price and quantity of a product
input by the user. The discount rate is 15% for the quantity purchased between 100 and 120 units, and 20% for
the quantity purchased greater than 120 units. If the quantity purchased is less than 100 units, the discount rate
is 0%. See the example output as shown below:

Ð•nter unit price: 25
Enter quantity: 110
The revenue from sale: 2337.5$
Discount: 412.5$(15.0%)
