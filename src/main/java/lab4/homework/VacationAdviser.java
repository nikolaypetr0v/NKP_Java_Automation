        5. Write a program which advices the user where to go to a vacation based on the type of the vacation and the
budget. There should be two options â€“ Beach, Mountain. If the user put a different value then the program
should print a message that there is no information about this type of vacation. Budgets are considered per
day per person. If the budget per day for Beach type vacation is smaller than 50 then the program should
advise Bulgaria as a destination, otherwise Outside Bulgaria. If the budget per day for Mountain type vacation
is smaller than 30 then the program should advise Bulgaria as a destination, otherwise Outside Bulgaria.
